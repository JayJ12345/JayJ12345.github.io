                    <h3>What Does The Table Mean?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For younger kids, an easier book like Geronimo Stilton is popular.</li>
                            <li>Among kids a little older, Warrior Cats is a popular book because of its more complex stories and slightly more mature themes.</li>
                            <li>With even older kids and into young teens, Wings of Fire is popular since it keeps the same concept of talking animals like Warrior Cats while also having an even more complex story. Although, Warrior Cats is still highly appreciated.</li>
